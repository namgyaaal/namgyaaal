Hello!

I graduated with a degree in Computer Science and Linguistics from UIUC in 2025. My current research focuses on figuring out ways to leverage machine learning to augment child therapy. As I result, most of my focus covers automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. 


During my free time, I am currently:
- Working on an open-source brick-building game to teach myself graphics, networking and backend web programmings ([Freebricks](https://github.com/namgyaaal/Freebricks)).
- Learning Dyalog APL.
